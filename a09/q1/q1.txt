Observations:

The time to run the synchronous read seems to take about the num_blocks * 0.01 seconds.
So each read takes about 0.01 seconds to elapse, give or take some fluctuation whithin the runtime.
This is because the program waits for each read to finish before starting a new read, making the time to run the program related to the number of blocks to be read.
This is shown on lines 43 and 44 of sRead.c, when the program loops until is_read_pending is false before continuing to loop over the block number.
